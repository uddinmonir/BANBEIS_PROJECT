  <li>Developing Mathematical Algorithms and Software for the
model order reduction of large-scale dynamical systems</li>
  <li>Purposes: Academic research and industrial applications</li>
  <li>
    Plans: Three years long project started in July 2019 and is
planned as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>1st year: Literature Review, understanding the problems
and developing some fundamental algorithms and software.</li>
      <li>2nd year: Developing algorithms and software for the
model reduction of model reduction of large-scale descriptor
systems, some numerical experiments and pressing in
conferences.</li>
      <li>3rd year: Numerical experiments with large-scale data in a
high-performance computer lab and preparing and
submitting papers and books for publications.
